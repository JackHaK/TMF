Officially, CompTIA A+ certification is a vendor neutral certification that covers numerous technologies and operating systems from such vendors as Microsoft, Apple Inc., Novell and some of the Linux distributions.</p>\r\n<p>The certification exams are computer-based and conducted by Pearson VUE approved centres. The certification is recognised by leading hardware, software and firmware manufacturers, resellers and support centres.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The certification exam was developed in 1993. There have been five versions of the A+ exam, the 1993, 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2012 objectives, which are broken down into two separate exams: A+ Essentials exam, and A+ Practical Application exam. The tests contain identification and situational questions in an adaptive format.</p>\r\n<p>The 2003 objectives contained the A+ Core Hardware Exam and the A+ Core Operating System Technologies Exam, which were retired on June 30, 2007. The 2006 objectives require that a candidate successfully pass the A+ Essentials and one elective: IT technician, remote support technician or depot technician. The 2009 certification requires passing two exams: Essentials and Practical Application.</p>\r\n<p>The A+ exam is intended for information technology professionals who have the equivalent of 500 hours of hands on experience. The exams are computer based and composed of multiple choice questions, of which there may be more than one correct answer. Over 800,000 people have earned the A+ credential worldwide, to date.</p>\r\n<p>The certification, being widely recognised, offers improved job prospects in the field of computer assembly and servicing.</p>\r\n<p>The examination for this course is booked directly with the examination testing body Pearson VUE.</p>\r\n<p>- For the website, go to:&nbsp;<a title=\"www.pearsonvue.com/comptia\" href=\"http://www.pearsonvue.com/comptia/\">http://www.pearsonvue.com/comptia/</a></p>\r\n<p>- For price information, please follow this link:&nbsp;<a title=\"www.pearsonvue.com/vouchers/pricelist/comptia.asp\" href=\"http://www.pearsonvue.com/vouchers/pricelist/comptia.asp\">http://www.pearsonvue.com/vouchers/pricelist/comptia.asp</a></p>", "default_start_time": null, "level_on_pdf": 1, "is_archived": true, "default_end_time": null, "tax_type": null}, {"days_text": null, "import_id": 7, "code": "64", "related_courses": null, "topics": "<p>Module 1: Introduction to Networks and Data Communications</p>\r\n<p>Module 2: Network Protocols and Network Devices</p>\r\n<p>Module 3: Local Area Networks</p>\r\n<p>Module 4: Wide Area Networks</p>\r\n<p>Module 5: Networking with TCP/IP</p>\r\n<p>Module 6: IP Addressing</p>\r\n<p>Module 7: IP Routing</p>\r\n<p>Module 8: TCP/IP Applications</p>\r\n<p>Module 9: Layer 2 Switching</p>\r\n<p>Module 10: Securing Network Access</p>\r\n<p>Module 11: Network Management</p>\r\n<p>Module 12: Network Troubleshooting<br /><br /></p>", "days": 5.0, "price": null, "course_text_9": null, "course_text_8": null, "mapped_items": [], "language_code": null, "pricing_band": {"id": 1, "name": "Low Tuition"}, "location_id": 0, "lms_summary": null, "uk_vat_rate": null, "title": "CompTIA Network+ Certification", "introduction": "<p><strong>Network+ Certification - (8306)&nbsp;</strong><br />This course is intended for network support professionals looking to broaden their understanding of networking technologies - both hardware and software.
